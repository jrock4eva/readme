# Introduction

[AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer) (aka ASan) is a memory error detector for C/C++.
It finds:
  * [Use after free](AddressSanitizerExampleUseAfterFree) (dangling pointer dereference)
  * [Heap buffer overflow](AddressSanitizerExampleHeapOutOfBounds)
  * [Stack buffer overflow](AddressSanitizerExampleStackOutOfBounds)
  * [Global buffer overflow](AddressSanitizerExampleGlobalOutOfBounds)
  * [Use after return](AddressSanitizerExampleUseAfterReturn)
  * [Initialization order bugs](AddressSanitizerInitializationOrderFiasco)

This tool is very fast. The average slowdown of the instrumented program is ~2x (see [AddressSanitizerPerformanceNumbers](AddressSanitizerPerformanceNumbers)).

The tool consists of a compiler instrumentation module (currently, an LLVM pass)
and a run-time library which replaces the `malloc` function.

The tool works on x86 Linux and Mac, and ARM Android.

# Getting AddressSanitizer

[AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer) is a part of [LLVM](http://llvm.org) starting with version 3.1 and a part of [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) starting with version 4.8
If you prefer to build from source, see [AddressSanitizerHowToBuild](AddressSanitizerHowToBuild).


So far, [AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer) has been tested only on Linux Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit
(it can run both 64- and 32-bit programs), Mac 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, and [AddressSanitizerOnAndroid](AddressSanitizerOnAndroid) 4.2+.


# Using AddressSanitizer
In order to use [AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer) you will need to compile and link your program using `clang` with the `-fsanitize=address` switch.
To get a reasonable performance add `-O1` or higher.
To get nicer stack traces in error messages add `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`.
Note: [Clang 3.1 release uses another flag syntax](http://llvm.org/releases/3.1/tools/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.html).

```
% cat tests/use-after-free.c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
  char *x = (char*)malloc(10 * sizeof(char*));
  free(x);
  return x[5];
}
% ../clang_build_Linux/Release+Asserts/bin/clang -fsanitize=address -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g   tests/use-after-free.c
```

Now, run the executable. [AddressSanitizerCallStack](AddressSanitizerCallStack) page describes how to obtain symbolized stack traces.

```

# Interaction with other tools
## gdb
See [AddressSanitizerAndDebugger](AddressSanitizerAndDebugger)


## ulimit -v
The `ulimit -v` command makes little sense with ASan-ified binaries
because ASan consumes 20 terabytes of virtual memory (plus a bit).

You may try more sophisticated tools to limit your memory consumption,
e.g. http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt

# Flags
See the separate [AddressSanitizerFlags](AddressSanitizerFlags) page.

# Call stack

See the separate [AddressSanitizerCallStack](AddressSanitizerCallStack) page.

# Incompatibility

Sometimes an [AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer) build may behave differently than the regular one. See [AddressSanitizerIncompatiblity](AddressSanitizerIncompatiblity) for details.

# Turning off instrumentation
In some cases a particular function should be ignored (not instrumented) by [AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer):
  * Ignore a very hot function known to be correct to speedup the app.
  * Ignore a function that does some low-level magic (e.g. walking through the thread's stack bypassing the frame boundaries).
  * Don't report a known problem.
In either case, be **very careful**.

To ignore certain functions, one can use the **no\_sanitize\_address**
attribute supported by Clang (3.3+) and GCC (4.8+). You can define the following macro:
```
#if defined(__clang__) || defined (__GNUC__)
# define ATTRIBUTE_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS __attribute__((no_sanitize_address))
#else
# define ATTRIBUTE_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS
#endif
...
ATTRIBUTE_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS
void ThisFunctionWillNotBeInstrumented() {...}
```

Clang 3.1 and 3.2 supported `__attribute__((no_address_safety_analysis))` instead.

You may also ignore certain functions using a blacklist: create a file `my_ignores.txt` and pass it to [AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer)
at compile time using `-fsanitize-blacklist=my_ignores.txt` (This flag is new and is only supported by Clang now):
```
# Ignore exactly this function (the names are mangled)
fun:MyFooBar
# Ignore MyFooBar(void) if it is in C++:
fun:_Z8MyFooBarv
# Ignore all function containing MyFooBar
fun:*MyFooBar*
```


# FAQ
  * Q: Can [AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer) continue running after reporting first error?
  * A: No, sorry. [AddressSanitizer](AddressSanitizer) errors are fatal. This design choice allows the tool to be faster and simpler.

  * Q: Why didn't ASan report an obviously invalid memory access in my code?
  * A1: If your errors is too obvious, compiler might have already optimized it out by the time Asan runs.
  * A2: Another, C-only option is accesses to global common symbols which are not protected by Asan (you can use -fno-common to disable generation of common symbols).

  * Q: When I link my shared library with -fsanitize=address, it fails due to some undefined ASan symbols (e.g. asan\_init\_v4)?
  * A: Most probably you link with -Wl,-z,defs or -Wl,--no-undefined. These flags don't work with ASan.

  * Q: My malloc stacktraces are too short?
  * A: Try to compile your code with -fno-omit-frame-pointer or set ASAN\_OPTIONS=fast\_unwind\_on\_malloc=0 (the latter would be a performance killer though unless you also specify malloc\_context\_size=2 or lower).

  * Q: I'm using dynamic ASan runtime and my program crashes at start with "Shadow memory range interleaves with an existing memory mapping. ASan cannot proceed correctly.".
  * A1: If you are using shared ASan DSO, try LD\_PRELOAD'ing Asan runtime into your program.
  * A2: Otherwise you are probably hitting a known limitation of dynamic runtime. Libasan is initialized at the end of program startup so if some preceeding library initializer did lots of memory allocations memory region required for ASan shadow memory could be occupied by unrelated mappings.

  * Q: The PC printed in ASan stack traces is consistently off by 1?
  * A: This is not a bug but rather a design choice. It is hard to compute exact size of preceding instruction on CISC platforms. So ASan just decrements 1 which is enough for tools like addr2line or readelf to symbolize addresses.

  * Q: I've ran with ASAN\_OPTIONS=verbosity=1 and ASan tells something like
```
 ==30654== Parsed ASAN_OPTIONS: verbosity=1
 ==30654== AddressSanitizer: failed to intercept 'memcpy'
```
  * A: This warning is false (see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58680 for details).

  * Q: I've built my main executable with ASan. Do I also need to build shared libraries?
  * A: ASan will work even if you rebuild just part of your program. But you'll have to rebuild all components to detect all errors.
